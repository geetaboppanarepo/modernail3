"""Ami, the agent, as a package. One module per element of goals.md:

    agent_profile     PROFILE     who the agent is — the system prompt
    memory            MEMORY      conversation memory and working memory; Stage 2 adds long-term memory
    planner           PLANNING    the ReAct loop (agent.py is the no-planning baseline)
    plan_execute      PLANNING    the second planner, plan-and-execute (Stage 2)
    tools, store      ACTION      seven tools with guardrails, over a fake order database (SQLite)
    policy            POLICY      rules between the model and the world (Stage 2)
    knowledge         KNOWLEDGE   the written rules in ../knowledge/, retrieved by
    embedder                      a small embedding model that runs on the laptop

    llm, pricing      the single model entry point, and what a call costs
    router            which model drafts a turn (cheap or strong), and why
    route_eval        cost-vs-quality metrics for evals.py --compare
    observe           the trace log every model and tool call writes to
    dashboard         the /logs page for web.py

The scripts that run it — main.py, web.py, evals.py, golden.py — live one
folder up, next to this package. Generated files go in ../state/ (sessions,
trace, customer records, orders.db, approvals.db) and ../.cache/ (the vector index and the model).
