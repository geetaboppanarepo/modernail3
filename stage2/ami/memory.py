"""Element 2 of the agent: MEMORY.

There are two kinds, and mixing them up is the usual beginner mistake.

CONVERSATION MEMORY — what was SAID.
    The transcript. Grows every turn, gets sent to the model on every call,
    and is the thing that makes turn 5 understand the word "it". Its job is
    recall, and its enemy is length.

WORKING MEMORY — what is KNOWN and DONE.
    The agent's scratchpad for the current task: facts confirmed by tools,
    actions already taken, the goal it is chasing. It is small, structured,
    and rewritten as the agent learns. Its job is not to remember words but
    to stop the agent repeating itself.

You can see the difference in one question: "did I already escalate this?"
The transcript can answer it only by re-reading everything. Working memory
answers it by looking at one field.

Stage 2 adds a third kind. LONG-TERM MEMORY — what is known about a
CUSTOMER across conversations (class LongTermMemory, kept in
state/customers.json). WorkingMemory also gains two fields, `turn` and
`pending`, which the policy layer uses to make a confirmation span two
turns. Everything else in this file is Stage 1. (HITL: `record` also
ignores a proposal that is waiting on a reviewer — nothing has happened.)
