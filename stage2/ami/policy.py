"""The policy layer: rules that sit BETWEEN the model and the world.

Three checkpoints, in the order a message flows:

    check_input   customer text  -> before it enters memory
    guarded_run   tool request   -> before a tool executes
    check_output  agent reply    -> before the customer sees it

Each one is plain code. The guardrails inside tools.py protect a single
tool from a bad call; this layer enforces rules that span tools, turns,
and the conversation itself — things no single tool can see:

  - a destructive action needs a confirmation that happened in a LATER
    turn than the request (so the model cannot confirm on the customer's
    behalf in the same breath)
  - an escalation is opened once per conversation, full stop
  - identifiers in a reply (tickets, RMAs, order numbers) must have come
    from a tool, or they get redacted
  - card numbers never reach the transcript; override attempts are
    labelled as such before the model reads them
  - a large refund needs a STAFF reviewer too, after the customer's yes.
    The call is saved as a proposal (approvals.py) and the turn ends; it
    runs only once a person approves it, from wherever they approve it
